AI: Hello there! I've successfully created the three tables you requested: `OS` (Operating System), `DBMS` (Database Management System), and `CN` (Computer Networks). Each table has been populated with more than 25 informative records, giving you a good foundation of concepts for each domain.

Here's a quick overview of what I've done:

*   **OS Table**: Contains 28 records covering fundamental concepts like Kernel, Process Management, Memory Management, File Systems, and various OS architectures.
*   **DBMS Table**: Contains 28 records detailing key database concepts such as DBMS types, SQL, relational database components, ACID properties, normalization, and NoSQL.
*   **CN Table**: Contains 27 records explaining essential networking concepts including IP addresses, protocols, network devices, the OSI and TCP/IP models, and network security.

Your database is now set up with these tables and their respective data. Let me know if you need anything else!
